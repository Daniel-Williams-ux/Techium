** <meta charset="UTF-8">**

The "meta charset" is an HTML tag that specifies the character encoding used for a web page. It is used to ensure that the browser displays the text content of a web page correctly, especially when the page contains non-ASCII characters such as accented letters or special symbols.

The meta charset tag is typically placed in the head section of an HTML document and looks like this:

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  ...
</head>
In the example above, the "UTF-8" encoding is specified as the character set for the web page. UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding that supports a wide range of characters, including those used in most languages around the world.

By specifying the correct character encoding for a web page, the meta charset tag helps ensure that the content is displayed correctly and is accessible to all users, regardless of their language or region.


**<meta name="viewport"  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover">**

This HTML meta tag is used to control the viewport behavior of a web page on mobile devices. Here's what each of the attributes means:

name: specifies the name of the metadata property, which in this case is "viewport".

content: specifies the value of the metadata property, which is a comma-separated list of values. In this case, there are three values specified:

width=device-width: sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen. This means that the content of the web page will automatically adjust to fit the screen size of the device.
initial-scale=1.0: sets the initial zoom level of the web page to 100%. This means that the content of the web page will be displayed at its original size without any zooming.
viewport-fit=cover: specifies how the web page should be displayed within the viewport. The value "cover" means that the content should be displayed to cover the entire viewport, even if this means cropping the content. This is useful for ensuring that the content is displayed properly on devices with different aspect ratios, such as the iPhone X with its "notch" at the top of the screen.
In summary, this meta tag is used to ensure that the content of a web page is displayed properly on mobile devices by adjusting the viewport size, setting the initial zoom level, and specifying how the content should be displayed within the viewport.
